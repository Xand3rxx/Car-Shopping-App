# Car Shopping App

A simple car shopping web app with Admin dashboard created in PHP.

# Features

2. Add Admin.

4. Upload vehicle to database.
5. Integration of Rave payment gateway by Flutterwave. 

# Login
Refresh browser page when the alert prompts you to after your credentials have been verified.

# How To
1. Open PHPMyAdmin, create a Database & import `cars.sql`. 
2. Open `admin/config.php` and fill up your MySql configuration.
3. Navigate to `admin/index.php` to access admin dashboard.


# Note that
Due to the time I started this project, and I had a deadline to meet up with, so some feaures were left out like
1. User error messages.
2. Proper validations.
3. Non functional buttons.
4. Session timer.
Therefore, the project still needs more work
